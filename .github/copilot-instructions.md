Welcome to the Revit plugin project. 

## Project Overview

**Revit Chat Assistant (RCA)** is an add-in for Autodesk Revit, designed to make working in Revit faster and more convenient with the help of an AI chat agent embedded in a dedicated panel.  

Similar to how GitHub Copilot works in VS Code or Visual Studio, Revit Chat Assistant (RCA) can modify the Revit model or answer user questions in response to natural language prompts.  

Like GitHub Copilot, RCA performs changes through program code generated by an LLM.  

RCA consists of two main components:  
- **Client side**: a Revit add-in written in C#, actual project.  
- **Server side**: a Python service that includes connectors to LLM providers, MCP, and orchestrates requests using LangChain.  

The code for Revit is generated either in Python 3 or in C# for .NET 8 (based on the Revit API 2025). Compilation is performed using **IronPython 3** (for Python code) or **Roslyn** (for C# code).

## Instructions for Writing C# Code

Follow these simple guidelines to generate clean, maintainable C# code.

1. Use PascalCase for all class, method, and property names.  
2. Use camelCase for all private fields and local variables.  
3. Add XML doc comments (`///`) above every public class and method.  
4. Keep each method focused on a single responsibility.  
5. Name files to match the primary class they contain.  
6. Organize code into folders by feature (e.g., `Commands`, `UI`, `Models`).  
7. Use `using` directives only for namespaces you reference.  
8. Avoid magic strings—define all literal strings as `const` or resource entries.  
9. Encapsulate long event handlers by extracting helper methods.  
10. Always check for `null` before accessing object members.  
11. Use `TaskDialog.Show` inside a dedicated helper to display messages.  
12. Group related properties in region blocks with clear names.  
13. Declare all Revit API calls inside `try`/`catch` and log exceptions.  
14. Write unit tests for all non-UI logic in a separate test project.  
15. Reference .NET 8 SDK and target `net8.0` in all project files.  
16. Commit small, focused changes with clear commit messages.  
17. Keep XAML markup minimal; define styles and resources externally.  
18. Use dependency injection for services and providers.  
19. Name boolean parameters or properties with “Is” or “Has” prefixes.  
20. Run `dotnet format` before each commit to enforce code style.
